# Weight- Temporally Coded Representation Learning (W-TCRL)

This is the code for the paper in submission in Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience "Enhanced representation learning with temporal coding in sparsely spiking neural networks".

**Training a new network:**

Use "python3 launch.py". 
Results are stored into pickle files.
