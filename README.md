# Weight- Temporally Coded Representation Learning (W-TCRL)

This is the code for the paper in submission in Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience "Exploiting Precise Spike Timing and Sparse Activity for Enhanced Representation Learning in Spiking Neural Networks".

**Training a new network:**

Use "python3 launch.py". 
Results are stored into pickle files.

The datasets used for this study are freely available in the following repositories: 

* MNIST: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
* NATURAL IMAGES: http://www.rctn.org/bruno/sparsenet/


**Example of learned filters trough 0, 100, ..., 60k training iterations**
